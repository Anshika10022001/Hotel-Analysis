# Hotel Booking Analysis
## Project Description

Aimed to analyze the Hotel Booking data and created Power BI Dashboard showing useful insights.

## Analysis Framework
 
- Data Gathering: Collected the releveant data from [Website](https://absentdata.com/data-analysis/where-to-find-data/) into the MS Excel
- Data preparation: The project involved using SQL aggregations to prepare and clean data for analysis. This included aggregating data from multiple sources and tables, filtering out irrelevant information, and performing calculations to derive meaningful insights.
- Generating important insights to present to the stakeholders and answering some important questions from the analysis:
#### 1. Is the hotel revenue growing year by year?
#### 2. Should the parking lot size be increased?
#### 3. What trends can we see in the data?
  
### The whole code can be seen step by step in the pdf file created in this repository [SQL Analysis](https://github.com/Anshika10022001/Hotel-Analysis/blob/main/hotel_pdf.pdf)

## Interactive Dashboard
- Dashboard: To present the analyzed information, the project included the development of an interactive dashboard. The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with features such as filters, graphs, and tables that allowed users to explore the data and discover key insights.
- Key insights: The dashboard provided useful insights about if the revenue is increasing year by year, total nights the customers stayed in hotel, average daily rate of the hotel, percentage of parking occupied by people on a night, etc. These insights were derived from the data analysis and were presented in an easy-to-understand format on the dashboard.


## Visualizations

The following report was successfully created in Microsoft PowerBI.

## Future Scope

- Actionable recommendations: Based on the insights generated from the dashboard, the project can provide actionable recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders. For example, recommendations could include investing in hotel infrastructure such as increased parking lot so that more tourists could stay,etc.
